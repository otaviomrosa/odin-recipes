        <p>Mapo Tofu is a famous Chinese dish composed mainly of tofu, meat and fermented bean curd.</p>
        <p>This dish has recently become very popular worldwide for its peculiar umami-filled taste. My roommate introduced me to this dish and I can't stop eating it due to its simplicity and great taste.</p>
